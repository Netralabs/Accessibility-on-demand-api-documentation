# Java — AOD-API

This folder contains **6 ready-to-run Java files**, one for each API step. The values you edit live in **one shared `config.json` at the repo root** — so every language folder (Java, .NET, Node, Python) reads the same config, and you fill it in **once**. Each `.java` file is self-contained (it includes a small built-in `AOD` helper at the bottom), so you run it directly with `java` — no build tool, no project setup.

**You only ever edit the root `config.json`.** The six step files read every value (API key, signed URLs, file IDs, level) from [config.json](../config.json). They never need editing.

Each step also writes its progress to a **`data.json` inside this `java/` folder** (created automatically) — that file is per-language and you don't touch it. Anything that **isn't** a clean success (a 207 partial upload, a non-200 response, or a failed job/report) is kept out of `data.json` and written to a separate **`errors.json`** instead, so your tracked data stays clean.

These files need **one library — Gson** — for reading and writing JSON. It's a single jar you download once.

For the full API reference (every endpoint, request, and response), see the [main README](../readme.md).

## Setup (one time)

**1. Check Java 11 or newer is installed** (Java 11+ runs a single `.java` file directly, no compile step):

```bash
java -version
```

(New to Java? A quick search for "how to install Java JDK" will get you set up.)

**2. Download Gson into a `lib` folder — run these from inside the `java/` folder.**
First `cd` into `java/`, then download. This creates `java/lib/gson.jar`, exactly where the run commands look for it.

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
cd java
mkdir -p lib && curl -L -o lib/gson.jar https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.11.0/gson-2.11.0.jar
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cd java
mkdir lib -Force; curl.exe -L -o lib/gson.jar https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.11.0/gson-2.11.0.jar
```

> Prefer to download by hand? Inside the `java/` folder, create a new folder named `lib`, save [this jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.11.0/gson-2.11.0.jar) into it, and rename it to `gson.jar` (so the path is `java/lib/gson.jar`).

**3. Open [config.json](../config.json) and set your `api_key`.** The other values (`sign_urls`, `process.file_id`, `report.file_id`) you fill in as you go — each step tells you what to set before running it.

You're now ready to run the steps in order.

## The one file you edit — [config.json](../config.json) (repo root)

```json
{
  "api_key": "aod-xxxxxxxxxxx",

  "description": "description about batch - optional",

  "sign_urls": [
    "https://your-signed-url-1",
    "https://your-signed-url-2"
  ],

  "user_batch_id": "my_batch1",
  "batch_name": "my_batch",

  "process": {
    "file_id": "",
    "level": 1,
    "requires_manual_review": false
  },

  "report": {
    "file_id": ""
  }
}
```

| Field | Used by | What to put |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `api_key`            | every step | Your key from Section 3 of the main README |
| `description`        | Step 1 | Optional text describing the batch (both upload options) |
| `sign_urls`        | Step 1 (Option B) | One or more signed URLs — only if you use `Step1UploadFromUrl.java`. *(Need one? See [How to get a signed URL](../docs/getting-signed-urls.md).)* |
| `user_batch_id`      | Step 1 | *Optional.* Your ID for the batch. Send **with** `batch_name` (both or neither) to place these files in a specific batch — or leave both blank to have one generated for you. See Endpoint 1 in the main README for the pairing rules. |
| `batch_name`         | Step 1 | *Optional.* Your name for the batch. Always paired with `user_batch_id`. |
| `process.file_id`    | Step 3 | An **uploaded** `file_id` (from Step 2) to process |
| `process.level`      | Step 3 | `1` or `2` |
| `process.requires_manual_review` | Step 3 | *Optional.* Set to `true` if you want to review and refine the tagging in the web UI before the tagged PDF becomes downloadable. Default `false` (fully automatic). |
| `report.file_id`     | Step 5 | The `file_id` you want a score report for |

You fill these in **as you go** — `sign_urls` before Step 1 (Option B; for Option A just drop PDFs in `uploads/`), `process.file_id` (and optionally `process.requires_manual_review`) before Step 3, `report.file_id` before Step 5. The steps tell you what to set next.

---

## The files

| Step | File | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| 1A | `Step1Upload.java`        | **Direct upload** — uploads every PDF in the repo-root `uploads/` folder (status starts as `Uploading`) |
| 1B | `Step1UploadFromUrl.java` | **Signed-URL upload** — uploads from `sign_urls` in `config.json` (use one *or* the other) |
| 2 | `Step2CheckUpload.java`  | Check **all** uploads → update each to `Uploaded` when ready |
| 3 | `Step3CreateJob.java`    | Start processing one file → get a `job_id` |
| 4 | `Step4CheckJob.java`     | Check **all** jobs → get the tagged-PDF download link |
| 5 | `Step5CreateReport.java` | Request a score report for one file → get a report `job_id` |
| 6 | `Step6CheckReport.java`  | Check **all** reports → get the score-report PDF download link |

### How values are shared between files

- **You → the scripts:** through the root **`../config.json`** (the only file you edit — shared by every language).
- **Between scripts:** through **`data.json` inside this `java/` folder**, which the scripts create and update automatically. Each language keeps its own `data.json`, so runs in different languages don't collide. Each step **prints its result on screen** and **saves the important values into `data.json`**. The "check" files (steps 2, 4, 6) read `data.json`, loop through everything, skip anything already finished, and update the rest — so they're safe to run repeatedly until done.

Each file has a small `AOD` helper class at the bottom (Base URL, headers, reads `../config.json`, reads/writes the local `data.json`, and logs problems to `errors.json`). You do **not** need to edit it.

### Errors — `errors.json`

`data.json` only ever holds clean, tracked items. Anything else is written to **`errors.json`** in this folder (created the first time something goes wrong). Entries are **grouped by what they relate to** and **appended** (full history — nothing is overwritten), each with a UTC timestamp:

| Section | What lands here | Carries |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| `url_errors`  | A signed URL that failed to upload (e.g. a 207 partial upload, "unsupported source") | `url` |
| `file_errors` | A problem tied to a `file_id` (can't check upload, 409 conflict, couldn't start job/report) | `file_id` |
| `job_errors`  | A problem tied to a `job_id` (job or report failed, unreadable response) | `job_id` |
| `other`        | Anything not clearly tied to one of the above (e.g. the whole request failed) | — |

Every entry also has `timestamp_utc` (ISO-8601, e.g. `2025-06-03T10:07:42Z`), `status_code`, a short `message`, and the original `raw` response/detail. Example:

```json
{
  "url_errors": [
    {
      "timestamp_utc": "2025-06-03T10:07:42Z",
      "url": "https://your-signed-url-2",
      "status_code": 207,
      "message": "unsupported source",
      "raw": { "url": "https://your-signed-url-2", "detail": "unsupported source" }
    }
  ],
  "file_errors": [
    {
      "timestamp_utc": "2025-06-03T10:09:10Z",
      "file_id": "file_abc",
      "status_code": 409,
      "message": "Conflict - file already processed",
      "raw": { "error": { "code": "CONFLICT" } }
    }
  ],
  "job_errors": [ ],
  "other": [ ]
}
```

Because it's append-only, `errors.json` is a running log — safe to re-run steps, and you can delete the file any time to start a fresh log.

## Paths & commands at a glance

Everything below assumes you have **opened a terminal and changed into this folder first**:

```bash
cd java
```

All commands are run from inside `java/`. The three files you care about:

| Purpose | File | Path (from inside `java/`) |
|---------|------|--------------------------------|
| **Edit** your inputs (api_key, sign_urls, file ids, level) | `config.json` | `../config.json` (repo root) |
| **View** your tracked results (file_ids, job_ids, download links) | `data.json` | `./data.json` (this folder) |
| **View** anything that failed (207 / errors / failed jobs) | `errors.json` | `./errors.json` (this folder) |

- To **edit** your values, open [config.json](../config.json) (one level up from here).
- To **see results**, open `java/data.json` after running a step.
- To **see failures**, open `java/errors.json` (created only when something goes wrong).

A step is always run the same way — `cd` in first, then run, e.g.:

```bash
cd java
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step1Upload.java
```

---

## How to run

First, move into the `java/` folder (do this once, in your terminal):

```bash
cd java
```

Then run each step from there. The only OS-specific part is the classpath separator before the jar: **Mac/Linux use `:`, Windows use `;`.** Run them in order — copy one line at a time.

**Mac / Linux:**

```bash
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step1Upload.java
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step1UploadFromUrl.java
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step2CheckUpload.java
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step3CreateJob.java
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step4CheckJob.java
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step5CreateReport.java
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step6CheckReport.java
```

**Windows:**

```bash
java -cp ".;lib\gson.jar" Step1Upload.java
java -cp ".;lib\gson.jar" Step1UploadFromUrl.java
java -cp ".;lib\gson.jar" Step2CheckUpload.java
java -cp ".;lib\gson.jar" Step3CreateJob.java
java -cp ".;lib\gson.jar" Step4CheckJob.java
java -cp ".;lib\gson.jar" Step5CreateReport.java
java -cp ".;lib\gson.jar" Step6CheckReport.java
```

> Note: `Step1Upload.java` and `Step1UploadFromUrl.java` are the **two upload options** — run only the one that fits you (see Step 1 below), not both.

> Run one line, wait for it to finish, then run the next. Steps 2, 4, and 6 are safe to re-run until everything shows as finished.

## Step-by-step

### Step 1 — Upload your file(s)

There are **two ways** to upload — pick the one that fits you. Both save the same thing to `data.json`, so Steps 2–6 are identical afterwards. Run **one** of them.

#### Option A — Direct upload from your computer → `Step1Upload.java`

Best if your PDFs are on your laptop and you don't have a cloud account.

1. Drop your PDF file(s) into the **`uploads/`** folder at the repo root.
2. (Optional) set `description` in [config.json](../config.json).
3. (Optional) set `user_batch_id` **and** `batch_name` in [config.json](../config.json) to place these files in a specific batch — set **both**, or leave **both** blank to have one generated for you.
4. Run:

```bash
cd java
```

```bash
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step1Upload.java
```

It automatically picks up **every PDF** in `uploads/` — no file paths to type. (Windows: use `-cp ".;lib\gson.jar"`.)

**Result:** each accepted file is saved to `data.json` with `status: "Uploading"` (and its `user_batch_id` / `batch_name`, so you can see which batch it landed in). If some files fail (status **207**, e.g. malware detected), those are logged to `errors.json` under `url_errors`; the successful ones are still saved.

#### Option B — Upload from signed URLs → `Step1UploadFromUrl.java`

Best if your files already live in S3 or Google Drive, or you already have signed URLs.

**In [config.json](../config.json):** set `api_key` and add your `sign_urls` (and optionally `description`). *(Need a signed URL? See [How to get a signed URL](../docs/getting-signed-urls.md).)*

*(Optional)* Also set `user_batch_id` **and** `batch_name` to place these files in a specific batch — set **both**, or leave **both** blank to have one generated for you.

```bash
cd java
```

```bash
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step1UploadFromUrl.java
```

**Result:** each accepted file is saved to `data.json` with `status: "Uploading"` (and its `user_batch_id` / `batch_name`, so you can see which batch it landed in). If some URLs fail (status **207**), the failures are written to `errors.json` under `url_errors` (the successful ones are still saved).

> ⏱️ Both uploads are rate-limited. Sending more files/URLs means a longer cooldown before your next upload (see the main README, Section 6).

**Next:** run Step 2.

---

### Step 2 — Check upload status → `Step2CheckUpload.java`

run below to check status of added for uploading

```bash
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step2CheckUpload.java
```

**Result:** prints the status of each file. Files already `Uploaded` are skipped; the rest are updated. Re-run until all show `Uploaded`.

**Next:** copy an uploaded `file_id` into `config.json` under `process.file_id`, then run Step 3.

---

### Step 3 — Start processing → `Step3CreateJob.java`

**In the root [config.json](../config.json):** set `process.file_id` to an uploaded `file_id`, and `process.level` to `1` or `2`.

*(Optional)* set `process.requires_manual_review` to `true` if you'd like to review and refine the tagging in the web UI before the tagged PDF becomes downloadable. Leave it as `false` for fully-automatic tagging.

```bash
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step3CreateJob.java
```

**Result:** a `job_id`, saved to `data.json` under `job_process` with `status: "Queued"`. If you enabled manual review, the entry is also flagged with `requires_manual_review: true` so you can see it later in `data.json`.

> ⏱️ This endpoint is rate-limited based on the number of pages in the file (see the main README, Section 6).

**Next:** check it in Step 4.

---

### Step 4 — Check job & get tagged PDF → `Step4CheckJob.java`

run below to check status of added in processing

```bash
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step4CheckJob.java
```

**Result:** prints the status of each job. When a job is `Completed`, the script saves and prints the **tagged PDF `download_url`**. Jobs already `Completed` are skipped. Any job that comes back `Failed` (or whose response can't be read) is logged to `errors.json` under `job_errors`, not `data.json`.

**Manual review pending?** If you started the job with `process.requires_manual_review: true` (Step 3), tagging can finish but the download link is held back until you complete the review in the web UI. In that case this step marks the job locally as **`AwaitingManualReview`** (and keeps polling it — it's not treated as "done"). You'll also get an email as soon as the file is ready to review. Then:

1. Go to **<https://app.accessibilityondemand.ai/login>** and log in.
2. Open the batch, select the file, and click **Review**.
3. On the last page of the review, click the **Complete** button.
4. Run `Step4CheckJob.java` again — the `download_url` will now be included.

> ⏳ The download link expires (see `expires_in_seconds`, e.g. 300 = 5 minutes). Download the PDF soon.

---

### Step 5 — Request a score report → `Step5CreateReport.java`

**In the root [config.json](../config.json):** set `report.file_id` to the file you want a report for.

```bash
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step5CreateReport.java
```

**Result:** a **report job_id**, saved to `data.json` under `report_process`.

---

### Step 6 — Get the score report → `Step6CheckReport.java`

run below to check status of added in generate report

```bash
java -cp ".:lib/gson.jar" Step6CheckReport.java
```

**Result:** prints the status of each report. When `Completed`, the script saves and prints the **score report PDF `download_url`**. A `Failed` report (or unreadable response) is logged to `errors.json` under `job_errors`.

> ⏳ Like the tagged PDF, this link also expires — download it soon before it get expire.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Where did my failures go?** Anything that wasn't a clean success is in **`errors.json`** (this folder), grouped into `url_errors` / `file_errors` / `job_errors` / `other`, newest appended last. `data.json` only keeps clean items.
- **`config.json was not found at ../config.json`** — run the command from inside the `java/` folder, with `config.json` sitting in the folder above it (the repo root).
- **`Please set your real "api_key"`** — `api_key` in `config.json` is still the placeholder. Paste your real key.
- **`No signed URLs found` / `No file_id given`** — the matching field in `config.json` is still blank or a placeholder. Fill it in.
- **`Batch pair is incomplete in config.json`** — you set only one of `user_batch_id` / `batch_name`. They always travel together: set **both** to target a specific batch, or clear **both** to have one auto-generated.
- **409 Conflict on upload** — the `user_batch_id` / `batch_name` pair you sent partially matches an existing batch (one value is already tied to a different partner). Use the matching partner value, pick a **new unique** pair, or clear both to auto-generate.
- **A job is stuck at `AwaitingManualReview`** — that's not stuck: you asked for manual review (`process.requires_manual_review: true` in Step 3) and the API is waiting for you. Log in at <https://app.accessibilityondemand.ai/login>, open the batch, select the file, click **Review**, and click **Complete** on the last page. Then re-run `Step4CheckJob.java`.
- **`error: cannot find symbol` / `package com.google.gson does not exist`** — Gson isn't on the classpath. Make sure `lib/gson.jar` exists and you included `-cp ".:lib/gson.jar"` (Mac/Linux) or `-cp ".;lib\gson.jar"` (Windows).
- **`class found in ... has wrong name`** — don't rename the files; each filename must match its class (e.g. `Step1Upload.java`).
- **`com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException` reading config.json** — the JSON is malformed (a missing comma or quote). Paste it into any JSON validator to find the spot.
- **401 Unauthorized** — your API key is missing, wrong, or has extra spaces. Re-check `api_key` in `config.json`.
- **429 Too Many Requests** — you're calling too fast. Wait the `retry-after-sec` seconds shown in the response and try again.
- **A URL failed with "unsupported source"** — only **S3** and **Google Drive** signed URLs are supported.

For the complete list of status codes and error shapes, see Section 9 of the [main README](../readme.md).
